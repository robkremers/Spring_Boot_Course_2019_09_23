The exercises have been implemented in Eclipse.

General notes:
- Java jdk 1.8 has been used.
- For each project:
	- Properties| Java Build Path| Libraries:
		- Exchange the standard Java library for JavaSE-1.8.
	- pom.xml:
		- maven-compiler-plugin:
			- configuration:
				- source: 1.8
				- target: 1.8
		- log4j:
			- Version: 1.2.14 --> 1.2.47
			- Reason: the downloaded 1.2.114 library was bad.

Regarding exercise1:

This is a basic classic spring application, using configuration xml files like it was done before annotations started to be used.
However even today many Java Spring applications use configuration xml files.

Note that in the situation of constructor Dependency Injection a default constructor needs to be added.
Otherwise the application will not compile.
