Topic: Specifics regarding the exercises whenever useful.
Date : 2019-12-09.

The exercises have been implemented in Eclipse.

General notes:
- Java jdk 1.8 has been used.
- For each project:
	- Properties| Java Build Path| Libraries:
		- Exchange the standard Java library for JavaSE-1.8.
	- pom.xml:
		- maven-compiler-plugin:
			- configuration:
				- source: 1.8
				- target: 1.8
		- log4j:
			- Version: 1.2.14 --> 1.2.47
			- Reason: the downloaded 1.2.114 library was bad.

Exercise1: Dependency injection with XML.

	This is a basic classic spring application, using configuration xml files like it was done before annotations started to be used.
	However even today many Java Spring applications use configuration xml files.

	Note that in the situation of constructor Dependency Injection a default constructor needs to be added.
	Otherwise the application will not compile.

Exercise2: Dependency injection with classpath scanning and autowiring.

	In the configuration xml file is only present:

	     <context:annotation-config/>
	     <context:component-scan base-package="customers"/>

	Autowiring constructors and setters is shown using @Component, @Service, @Autowired.

Exercise3: Dependency injection with Java Config.

	Method: 
	- Create a @Configuration class.
	- Define @Beans in the @Configuration class.
		- The @Bean methods can use setters / constructors for wiring or alternatively @Autowired can be used.
